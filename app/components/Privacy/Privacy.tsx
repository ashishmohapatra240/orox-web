        <p>
          We may collect your personal data in three ways: 1) receive directly
          from you; 2) generate or collect while you visit the OROX Platform or
          use our Products or Services; and 3) receive from third parties.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p className="font-bold">Information received directly from you</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          To create an account such as a OROX Account with us and use our
          Products and/or Services, you need to provide us with certain
          information. We collect such information because it is necessary to
          provide the requested Products or Services (e.g., when you make a
          withdrawal request, we will ask for a withdrawal address), required by
          law (e.g., we collect your selfie and government-issued photo ID to
          verify your identity and comply with relevant AML/CFT regulations), or
          for certain other specific purposes that we will describe in further
          detail below.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          You have a choice regarding whether to provide us with your personal
          data. Please note that if you choose not to provide us with certain
          information that is required by law or under the terms of a contract
          we have with you or are in the process of entering into, we may not be
          able to offer you our Products or Services (e.g., if you do not want
          to provide information necessary to create a OROX Account) or our
          Products or Services may not be best tailored to your interests or
          preferences.

        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          When you create a OROX Account, we assign you a unique ID number. This
          allows us to recognise you when you sign in on a new device or through
          a different platform (e.g., say you usually access your account via
          our website{" "}

          , but now want to sign in via our OROX mobile app). Once we verify
          your identity through our Know Your Customer (KYC) process, we also
          assign you a unique Referral Code which you may use to invite your
          friends to create a OROX Account and use our Products or Services and
          be eligible for rewards if you meet certain criteria under our
          Referral Program Terms, available prior to program launch.

        <p>
          In addition, we also collect information about your devices, and your
          interactions with and activities across our Products, Services, and/or
          the OROX Platform (including, without limitation, your transactions).
          We use this information to provide the requested Products, Services,
          or OROX Platform; detect any suspicious activity and prevent fraud;
          offer you more personalised services and features; improve the
          performances of our Products, Services, or the OROX Platform, and
          develop new Products or Services; and address customer support issues.
          For example, collecting your device type allows us to show you the
          best version of the OROX Platform. We may use cookies and other
          similar technologies to collect some of this information.
